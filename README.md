# Bulletin
Responsive sticky-note bulletin board based on the [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com) tutorial, [Learn React.js: The Basics](http://www.lynda.com/React-js-tutorials/Learn-React-js-Basics/379264-2.html), taught by [Eve Porcello](http://www.lynda.com/Eve-Porcello/1874244-1.html). 
This project uses React.js to create and store editable note objects in JSON, and uses jQuery to make the notes draggable.
